abstract = {The authors are concerned with a new method of fitting a physical model function to a magnetic resonance signal, directly in the time domain. Their primary aim is analysis of the signal in quantitative terms, i.e., describing the signal in terms of physically meaningful parameters with their statistical errors. Before explaining the new method they make some remarks about the place of time-domain model fitting in spectral analysis},

@article{Klose1990,
abstract = {Spatially localized methods in spectroscopy often operate with magnetic field gradients for volume selection. The eddy currents induced by these gradients produce time-dependent shifts of the resonance frequency in the selected volume, which results in a distortion of the spectrum after Fourier transformation. In whole-body systems the complete compensation of eddy currents is a difficult procedure. To avoid this, a correction method is proposed for proton spectroscopy, which uses the signal of prominent water protons as a reference for the water-suppressed signal. The correction is performed in the time domain, dividing the water-suppressed signal by the phase factor of the water signal for each data point. The corrected spectra have a good resolution as shown by phantom measurements and brain and muscle spectra of volunteers.},

@article{Mescher1998,
abstract = {Water suppression is typically performed in vivo by exciting the longitudinal magnetization in combination with dephasing, or by using frequency-selective coherence generation. MEGA, a frequency-selective refocusing technique, can be placed into any pulse sequence element designed to generate a Hahn spin-echo or stimulated echo, to dephase transverse water coherences with minimal spectral distortions. Water suppression performance was verified in vivo using stimulated echo acquisition mode (STEAM) localization, which provided water suppression comparable with that achieved with four selective pulses in 3,1-DRYSTEAM. The advantage of the proposed method was exploited for editing J-coupled resonances. Using a double-banded pulse that selectively inverts a J-coupling partner and simultaneously suppresses water, efficient metabolite editing was achieved in the point resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) and STEAM sequences in which MEGA was incorporated. To illustrate the efficiency of the method, the detection of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was demonstrated, with minimal contributions from macromolecules and overlying singlet peaks at 4 T. The estimated occipital GABA concentration was consistent with previous reports, suggesting that editing for GABA is efficient when based on MEGA at high field strengths.},

@article{Mullins2014,
abstract = {There is increasing interest in the use of edited proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy for the detection of GABA in the human brain. At a recent meeting held at Cardiff University, a number of spectroscopy groups met to discuss the acquisition, analysis and interpretation of GABA-edited MR spectra. This paper aims to set out the issues discussed at this meeting, reporting areas of consensus around parameters and procedures in the field and highlighting those areas where differences remain. It is hoped that this paper can fulfill two needs, providing a summary of the current 'state-of-the-art' in the field of GABA-edited MRS at 3T using MEGA-PRESS and a basic guide to help researchers new to the field to avoid some of the pitfalls inherent in the acquisition and processing of edited MRS for GABA.},
